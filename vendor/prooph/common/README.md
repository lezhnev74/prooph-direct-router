Common classes shared between prooph components

## Note about versions

The 4.0 release is only for the newer prooph-components (event-store v7, service-bus v6, and so on). If you are using
an older version of prooph/event-store or prooph/service bus, stick to 3.x series.

## Shared Kernel

Prooph components work with [php-fig](http://www.php-fig.org/) standards and other de facto standards like [Container-Interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) whenever possible.
But they also share some prooph software specific classes. These common classes are included in this repository.
